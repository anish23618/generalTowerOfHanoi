# generalTowerOfHanoi
An implementation of cp-sat solver for generalized tower of hanoi

## Tower of Hanoi Problem
- We have 3 rods, and N number of disc surrounds the first rod. 
- The disc can only be arrange from larger to smaller diameters from below to top.
- At a time, only the top disc can be moved from one rod to other.
- The goal is to move all the disc from first rod to second rod.

 It is known that the best algorithm takes 2^N -1 steps, for this version of the problem.

 ## Generalized Tower of Hanoi
- We have K rods, and N number of disc surrounds the first rod. 
- The disc can only be arrange from larger to smaller diameters from below to top.
- At a time, only the top disc can be moved from one rod to other.
- The goal is to move all the disc from first rod to second rod.

This code solves the problem using the CP-SAT library. This is not the best possible implementation, but is meant to demonstrate the power to CP-sat to solve a algorithmic problem using a optimization.
In some sense this algorithm is what one would implement on a non-deterministic turing machine to solve this problem.
 
## Algorithm to solve generalized Tower of Hanoi.
 Only variables are:
 - NO_PILLER: int          : number of pillar to consider,
 - NO_DISC: int            : number of disc to consider,
 - MAX_RUN_TIME : float    : maximum no. of seconds to run,
 At the beginning, all the discs are placed on first pillar.
 At the end, we want all the disc to be on the last pillar.
### Example:
 for NO_PILLER = 4,NO_DISC = 4, the solution is
 [0 1 2 3][][][]  
 [1 2 3][][][0]  
 [2 3][][1][0]  
 [3][2][1][0]  
 [3][2][0 1][]  
 [][2][0 1][3]  
 [0][2][1][3]  
 [0][][1][2 3]  
 [0][][][1 2 3]  
 [][][][0 1 2 3]  

 Each bracket represts a pillar. 
 The number within them represent the disc, 
 where lower no. represts smaller diameter.
